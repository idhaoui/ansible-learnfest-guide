## Setup your LearnFest Environment

For the Ansible LearnFest we use the [Ansible Automation Controller for Advanced Users Workshop](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.automation-controller-advanced.prod) from RHPDS. If you run this workshop during Red Hat Tech Exchange, a lab was already created and details will be provided to you.

If you provision or order your own lab, make sure you enable the private automation hub.
